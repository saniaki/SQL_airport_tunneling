## Phase 1: Finding two most approperiate airports to construct a high-speed rail tunnel

Criteria: 
* two airports must be between 300 and 400 miles apart
* at least 5000 average flights per year between airports, in each direction
* airport pair with largest total number of seats on the planes between them

What to report:
* pair of airports with above criteria
* average arrival delay for flights between them
* average flight distance (in miles) between airports, in each direction
* average number of flights per year between airports, in each direction
* average yearly total number of seats (passengers) on the planes between the two airports

### Examining data
Following quesries are used to examin data in Hue.

setting "fly" database as current

Showing columns in the "flights" and "planes" tables:
<pre>
SHOW TABLES fly.flights;

### SQL query
<pre>
SELECT origin, dest,<br>
        ROUND(CAST(COUNT(*) AS decimal)/10) AS avg_num_flights,<br>
        SUM(seats) AS tot_num_seats,<br>
        ROUND(CAST(SUM(seats) AS decimal)/10) AS avg_annual_num_pass,<br>
        ROUND(AVG(distance)) AS avg_flight_dist,<br>
        ROUND(AVG(arr_delay)) AS avg_arr_delay_minutes<br>
FROM fly.flights AS f<br>
LEFT OUTER JOIN fly.planes AS p<br>
        ON f.tailnum = p.tailnum<br>
WHERE distance BETWEEN 300 AND 400<br>
GROUP BY origin, dest<br>
        HAVING avg_num_flights >= 5000  <br>
ORDER BY tot_num_seats DESC;<br>
</pre>


### Results

First and second directions:

<pre>
                                                First direction     Second direction
Three-letter airport code for origin	        SFO	                LAX
Three-letter airport code for destination	   LAX	                SFO
Average flight distance in miles	           337	                337
Average number of flights per year	           14712	            14540
Average annual passenger capacity	           1996597	            1981059
Average arrival delay in minutes	           10	                14
</pre>

Sanity checks: 
* Average flight distance is expected to be the same for each pairs
* Average flight distance for all rows in the results table should be between 300 and 400
* Average flight distance for all rows in the results table should be between 300 and 400
