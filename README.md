**Data** : <br>
1 - fly database
* Ten full years of data, representing flights and airports statistics from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2017. 
* Four tables, flights (61392822 rows), planes (453361 rows), airports (1333 rows), airlines (25 rows)
* Source https://www.bts.dot.gov/newsroom/2018-traffic-data-us-airlines-and-foreign-airlines-us-flights  <br>

2 - Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs) data files
* Three TBMs are used for three section of tunnel: Bertha II, Shai-Hulud, and Diggy McDigface
* TBMS are generating data as they are working, the format of generated data is slightly different for each machine
* Number of data: Bertha II (91619), Shai-Hulud (94237), Diggy McDigface (93163)

**SQL query engine**:
*Impala using Hue web interface

## Phase 1: Finding two most appropriate airports to construct a high-speed rail tunnel

*Criteria*: 
* two airports must be between 300 and 400 miles apart
* at least 5000 average flights per year between airports, in each direction
* airport pair with largest total number of seats on the planes between them

*Goals*:
* pair of airports with above criteria
* average arrival delay for flights between them
* average flight distance (in miles) between airports, in each direction
* average number of flights per year between airports, in each direction
* average yearly total number of seats (passengers) on the planes between the two airports

### Examining data

### SQL query
Following query is used in Impala to answer the questions presented in the "Goals" above.
<pre>
SELECT origin, dest,<br>
        ROUND(CAST(COUNT(*) AS decimal)/10) AS avg_num_flights,<br>
        SUM(seats) AS tot_num_seats,<br>
        ROUND(CAST(SUM(seats) AS decimal)/10) AS avg_annual_num_pass,<br>
        ROUND(AVG(distance)) AS avg_flight_dist,<br>
        ROUND(AVG(arr_delay)) AS avg_arr_delay_minutes<br>
FROM fly.flights AS f<br>
LEFT OUTER JOIN fly.planes AS p<br>
        ON f.tailnum = p.tailnum<br>
WHERE distance BETWEEN 300 AND 400<br>
GROUP BY origin, dest<br>
        HAVING avg_num_flights >= 5000  <br>
ORDER BY tot_num_seats DESC;<br>
</pre>


### Results
First 8 rows of the results table:

<p align="center">
<img  align="center" src="https://github.com/saniaki/SQL_airport_tunneling/blob/main/images/Results.jpg" width="900"/>


A summary of results from first two rows of the results table:

<pre>
                                                First direction     Second direction
Three-letter airport code for origin            SFO	                LAX
Three-letter airport code for destination       LAX	                SFO
Average flight distance in miles                337	                337
Average number of flights per year              14712                   14540
Average annual passenger capacity               1996597                 1981059
Average arrival delay in minutes                10	                14
</pre>

Sanity checks: 
* Average flight distance is expected to be the same for each pairs
* Average flight distance for all rows in the results table should be between 300 and 400
* Average flight distance for all rows in the results table should be between 300 and 400


## Phase 2: Creating a table for generated data from different Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs) 
*Problem description*:
* The tunnel is constructed in three sections, where a different TBM is used for each section. Data generated from these TBMs are stored in separate data files on Amazon S3. The format of data is also different.

*Goal*:
* Generating a table on HDFS including data from all three TBMs.

### Examining data files
Following queries are used to examine data using AWS CLI (Amazon Web Service Command Line Interface)
<pre>
aws s3 ls s3://training-coursera2/tbm_sf_la/
</pre>
<p align="center">
<img  align="center" src="https://github.com/saniaki/SQL_airport_tunneling/blob/main/images/AWS%20Examining_01.jpg" width="100"/>
    
<pre>
aws s3 cp s3://training-coursera2/tbm_sf_la/central/hourly_central.csv -|head
</pre>
<p align="center">
<img  align="center" src="https://github.com/saniaki/SQL_airport_tunneling/blob/main/images/AWS%20Examining_02.jpg" width="400"/>
    
<pre>
aws s3 cp s3://training-coursera2/tbm_sf_la/north/hourly_north.csv -|head
</pre>
<p align="center">
<img  align="center" src="https://github.com/saniaki/SQL_airport_tunneling/blob/main/images/AWS%20Examining_03.jpg" width="450"/>
    
<pre>
aws s3 cp s3://training-coursera2/tbm_sf_la/south/hourly_south.tsv -|head
</pre>
<p align="center">
<img  align="center" src="https://github.com/saniaki/SQL_airport_tunneling/blob/main/images/AWS%20Examining_04.jpg" width="550"/>

*Observations*:
* Data are generated hourly including (tbm, year, month, day, hour, distance, longitude, latitude)
* First and second data files are comma delimited and third data files is tab delimited
* Value 999999 is used instead of NULL values in first data file
* First data file has a header


### Creating three individual tables in HDFS for each TBM (boring machine)
For first TBM (central)
<pre>
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE dig.tbm_sf_la_central
    (tbm STRING,year SMALLINT,month TINYINT,day TINYINT,hour TINYINT,
    dist DECIMAL(8,2),lon DOUBLE,lat DOUBLE)
    ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    TBLPROPERTIES('skip.header.line.count'='1','serialization.null.format'='999999');
</pre>
For second TBM (north)
<pre>
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE dig.tbm_sf_la_north
    (tbm STRING,year SMALLINT,month TINYINT,day TINYINT,hour TINYINT,
    dist DECIMAL(8,2),lon DOUBLE,lat DOUBLE)
    ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';
</pre>
For third TBM (south)
<pre>
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE dig.tbm_sf_la_south
    (tbm STRING,year SMALLINT,month TINYINT,day TINYINT,hour TINYINT,
    dist DECIMAL(8,2),lon DOUBLE,lat DOUBLE)
    ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t';
</pre>


### Loading data files into the tables directories on HDFS
These three command lines are used to download data from S3 into the HDFS
<pre>
hdfs dfs -cp s3a://training-coursera2/tbm_sf_la/central/hourly_central.csv /user/hive/warehouse/dig.db/tbm_sf_la_central/
</pre>

<pre>
hdfs dfs -cp s3a://training-coursera2/tbm_sf_la/north/hourly_north.csv /user/hive/warehouse/dig.db/tbm_sf_la_north/
</pre>

<pre>
hdfs dfs -cp s3a://training-coursera2/tbm_sf_la/south/hourly_south.tsv /user/hive/warehouse/dig.db/tbm_sf_la_south/
</pre>

### Combining individual tables into a single table including all data, CTAS method is used
Following SQL statement is used to create a new table that combines the three individual tables created before:
<pre>
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE dig.tbm_sf_la AS
    SELECT tbm, year, month, day, hour, dist, lon, lat
        FROM dig.tbm_sf_la_central
    UNION ALL
    SELECT tbm, year, month, day, hour, dist, lon, lat
        FROM dig.tbm_sf_la_north
    UNION ALL
    SELECT tbm, year, month, day, hour, dist, lon, lat
        FROM dig.tbm_sf_la_south;
</pre>

### Results
A sample of few rows from final table:
<pre>
SELECT * FROM dig.tbm_sf_la
    ORDER BY dist
    LIMIT 10;
</pre>
<p align="center">
<img  align="center" src="https://github.com/saniaki/SQL_airport_tunneling/blob/main/images/TBM%20Results%20Sample.jpg" width="900"/>


Number of rows for each TBM
<pre>
SELECT tbm, COUNT(*) AS num_rows FROM dig.tbm_sf_la GROUP BY tbm ORDER BY tbm;
</pre>

<pre>
(TBM)               (num_rows)
Bertha II           91619
Diggy McDigface     93163
Shai-Hulud          94237
</pre>
